# Setup

Install packages: 
`npm install`

Copy file .env.sample to a new file .env

Adapt the MONGO_URI to your Database (either on ATLAS or local MongoDB installation)

Start API:
`npm run dev`

The API will not automatically start a browser.

It should start on http://localhost:5000.
The URL should get shown in terminal and you can open it by clicking on it.

Enjoy adapting, little grasshopper!
